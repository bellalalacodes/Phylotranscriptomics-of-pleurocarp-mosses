# Phylotranscriptomics-of-pleurocarp-mosses
Phylotranscriptomic analyses of ~100 transcriptomes of pleurocarp mosses, focussing on genes that diversified along with the diversification of pleurocarps.
The goal is to identify genetic signatures of processes like whole genome duplication and changes in selection to understand the molecular evolution of the taxon.
Identified genes could be further studied in functional analyses.
